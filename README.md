### What I learned


Mastering CSS Flexbox without relying on libraries was a pivotal learning experience for me in this project. Building a project solely with Flexbox deepened my understanding of its capabilities and refined my CSS skills. Through hands-on experimentation, I gained insights into Flexbox's versatility and its ability to create responsive layouts effortlessly. Embracing pure CSS allowed me to explore creative solutions and understand the trade-offs between libraries and custom code. This experience has equipped me with the confidence and skills to tackle future design challenges effectively.
